# flippin_cakes
This is our end of year Group H20 CSCE 121 Pancake Sorting Project 

This game was created using C++, and involves flipping and ordering a stack of virtual pancakes

This game requires you to have FLTK(Fast Light Toolkit) installed in order to run. We used some FLTK interface files that were provided to us in conjunction with the code that we wrote.

These files can be compiled by running the command "g++ -std=c++14 *cpp *o -lfltk -lfltk_images" in the main folder.
